{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson For once in my life par Stevie Wonder\r\nFor once in my life I have someone who needs me\nSomeone I've needed so long\nFor once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me\nSomehow I know I'll be strong\n\nFor once I can touch what my heart used to dream of\nLong before I knew\nOooh Someone warm like you\nWould make my dream come true\n\nYeah yeah yeah \n\nFor once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me\nNot like it hurt me before\nFor once, I have something I know won't desert me\n\nI'm not alone anymore\n\nFor once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it\nAs long as I know I have love, I can make it\nFor once in my life, I have someone who needs me\n\nHE He He Hey yeah \nooh baby ooh baby\n\nFor once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me\nNot like it hurt me before\nFor once, I have something I know won't desert me\nI'm not alone anymore\n\nFor once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it\nLong as I know I have love, I can make it\n\nFor once in my life, I have someone who needs me\n\nFor once in my life\nYeah Somebody like my\nOoh baby\n\n(fade)"}
