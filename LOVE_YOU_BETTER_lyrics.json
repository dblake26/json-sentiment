{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson LOVE YOU BETTER par Future\r\nCould this thing be more?\nYou can never this could be yours\nIf it's really meant to baby, baby\n'Cause I'm interested, baby, baby\nATL Jacob, ATL Jacob\n\nYou tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me\nHope you can find someone to love you better than I did\n\nTakin' our memories on love and treatin' it like nothin'\nTakin' our memories on love and treatin' it like gossip\nIt's my love from my grandmother make me gentle when I care for you\n\nTell me you fallin' out of love, it's breakin' my heart in two\nI just don't wanna sit and pray, baby\nAlmost like it didn't happen to make you happy\n\nYou tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me\nHope you can find someone to love you better than I did\nYou tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me (You tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me)\nHope you can find someone to love you better than I did (Hope you can find someone to love you better than I did)\n\nYou tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me\nCould this thing be more?\nIt's my love from my grandmother make me gentle when I care for you (Hope you can find someone to love you better than I did)\n\nIf it's really meant to baby, baby\n'Cause I'm interested, baby, baby"}
